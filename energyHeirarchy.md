## Things in the world are a product of energy from: energy, water, and rocks.
```
Sun -> plants -> bacteria
    -> humans -> land animals -> sea animals
```

```
If you shine a light over an earth for a billion years ... 
     humans grow, cities pop up, and then a rocket transfers life to another planet.
```
	
## What are the core competencies of humans?
```
communication -> remembering -> transferring knowledge -> organizing work -> 
   tools to build shelters and preserve knowledge -> platforms to distribut knowledge to masses
```

## What Good things do humans contribute?
```
artificial shelter/ -> shelter from the sun, wind, heat, cool, water, these things can cause chaos.
   -> knowledge accumulation

cultivation/ farming plants. (plants provide food) (allows growth of things that are edible)
cultivation/ livestock. (animals provide food and a workforce that can be channeled to build shelter.)


cultivation/ cleaning water 
transport(fuel/roads) -> work can be distributed across larger areas and communication improves.
electricity(networking/wifi) -> communication and learning improves 

sanitation -> health standards improve... empowering knowledge development and organizing of knowledge.
```

## What is the benefit humans can provide?
1) (speed up/ improve the efficiency) of living organism growth from energy by 
<br/>leveraging knowledge to provide proper utilities.

2) Try to create our own energy to make life sustainable.
3) Look at the earth as a storage device. preserved with living organizms or solar panels. 
<br/>We could store energy on other planets too if we put living organizms there.
<br/>Are we limited by having a finite amount of water?

Some resources will take longer to build: complex plants, apex predators in a natural terraform environment, fossil fuels, stainless steel.

## Workers and their Types:
Planners: architect, engineer, biologist
<br/>Workers: construction, farm/fish, network techs.
<br/>Maintainance Workers: construction, cleaners, medics.

## What is humanity currently working on?
1) Improving communication, currently communication looks bad because there are more options so it is hard to settle or select choices as competitive creatures in a competitive environment.
2) Becoming conscious about energy usage, energy cultivation, interacting with our environment.
3) Back to communication: Saying more with less, uplifting others that are ambitious and seeking to pave the way. Finding divinci's in your city.


## Do cities have industries or are they influenced by the surrounding gatherer areas?
```
Logistics/boat transports/rails/trucks/planes = communication making area availiable to farm wider.
Stock Market = food for all seasons.
Harbors = fishing
Pooled resources ... since all of the people are in one area. Interconectivity can be encouraged.
Speciality, being able to create those Utilities first for sustainability and then for the outside areas.
```

## Things that need maintainence
```
humans
  -> healthcare, teachers, police, psych wards, entertainment ... etc.
buildings
  -> builders/construction, plumbing, firefighters, police ... etc.
plants and animals
  -> vetrenereans 
```
