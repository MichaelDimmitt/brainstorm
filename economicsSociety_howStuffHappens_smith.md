<br/>Nice to have: accomidate diversity. public works, encouraging safe connectivity

## Miscelaneous Notes
Industries that should not generate wealth:
<br/>Housing Industry: housing values should be constant or slowly depreciate but never increase and should be based off charging yourself rent.

Additional themes for consideration:
<br/>Community, Society's Responsibility, Culture

## Societies Responsibility:
Certain things make sense to be handled by the government or government non-profits.
<br/>Things that are not supposed to make a profit, example general insuraince.
<br/>Insuraince is supposed to alleviate risk. There should be a finger print of every fund put into insuraince.
1) You should not be punished but should know how you have impacted the collective fund. 
2) You could gamify it for the positive case. how you compare with the other compliant people in the city.
3) An imaginary ticket system healthy people can provide to someone in need.
<br/>If that person becomes sick the ticket vanishes.
<br/>Insuraince can only support what the person could contribute lifetime. 
<br/>Imaginary tickets allow the non-profit to be more flexible for the person down on their luck. 
<br/>But leveraging social capital makes the system harder to game and humans can change their mind, ppl earn it.

## Teaching:
Efforts should be made to make the process automated or an effort to learn from each other.
<br/>Mentor programs ... etc.
<br/>General education levels up the community and foundational information such as strong algerbra skills/english can be very important.
<br/>Keeping kids busy and happy helps the workforce stay focused.
